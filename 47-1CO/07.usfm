\c 7
\p
\v 1 Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: there are times when it is good for a man not to sleep with his wife.
\v 2 But because of temptations for many immoral acts, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband.

\s5
\v 3 The husband should give to the wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband.
\v 4 It is not the wife who has authority over her own body, it is the husband. And likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.

\s5
\v 5 Do not deprive each other of sleeping together, except by mutual agreement and for a specific period of time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. And then you may come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
\p
\v 6 But I say these things to you more as a concession and not as a command. 
\v 7 I wish that everyone was as I am. But each one has his own gift from God, one of this kind and another of that kind.

\s5
\v 8 To the unmarried and to widows I say that it is good for them if they remain unmarried, as I am.
\v 9 But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better for them to marry than to burn with passion.

\s5
\v 10 Now to the married I give this command—not I, but the Lord: "The wife should not separate from her husband."
\v 11 But if she does separate from her husband, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to him. And, "The husband should not divorce his wife."

\s5
\v 12 But to the rest I say (I, not the Lord), that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she is content to live with him, he should not divorce her.
\v 13 And if a woman has an unbelieving husband and he is content to live with her, she should not divorce him. 
\v 14 For the unbelieving husband is set apart because of his believing wife, and the unbelieving woman is set apart because of her husband who believes. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but actually they are set apart. 

\s5
\v 15 But if the non-Christian partner departs, let him go. In such cases, the brother or sister is not bound to their vows. God has called us to live in peace.
\v 16 For how do you know, woman, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, man, whether you will save your wife?

\s5
\v 17 Only let each one live the life the Lord has assigned them, and to which God called them.  This is my rule in all the churches.
\v 18 Was anyone circumcised when he was called to believe? He should not try to remove the marks of his circumcision. Was anyone uncircumcised when he was called to faith? He should not be circumcised. 
\v 19 For it is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision that matters. What matters is obeying the commandments of God.

\s5
\v 20 Each one should remain in the calling he was in when God called him to believe. 
\v 21 Were you a slave when God called you? Do not be concerned about it. But if you can become free, do so.
\v 22 For someone who is called by the Lord as a slave is the Lord's freeman. Likewise the one who was free when he was called to believe is Christ’s slave.
\v 23 You have been bought with a price, so do not become slaves of men.
\v 24 Brothers and sisters, in whatever life each of us was in when we were called to believe, let us remain like that.

\s5
\p
\v 25 Now concerning those who never married, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who, by the Lord's mercy, is trustworthy.
\v 26 Therefore, I think that because of the impending crisis, it is good for a man to remain as he is.

\s5
\v 27 Are you bound to a woman by a vow of marriage? Do not seek freedom from it. Are you free from a wife or are unmarried? Do not seek a wife.
\v 28 But if you do marry, you have not committed a sin. And if an unmarried woman marries, she has committed no sin. Yet those who marry will have many kinds of trouble while living, and I would like to spare you from them.

\s5
\v 29 But this I say, brothers and sisters: The time is short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none.
\v 30 Those who weep should act as though they had not wept; and those who rejoiced, as though they did not rejoice; and those who bought anything, as though they did not have their possessions,
\v 31 and those who deal with the world, as though they had no dealings with it, for the system of this world is coming to an end.

\s5
\v 32 I would like you to be free from worries. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to please him. 
\v 33 But the married man is concerned about the things of the world, how to please his wife.
\v 34 He is divided. So also the unmarried person or the virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and in spirit. But the married woman is also concerned about the things of the world, how to please her husband.

\s5
\v 35 I say this for your own benefit, and not to put any constraint on you, but for what is right, so that you may be devoted to the Lord without any distraction. 

\s5
\v 36 But if anyone thinks that he is not treating his fiancée with respect because his passions are too strong, let him marry her as he wishes. It is not a sin. 
\v 37 But if he has made a decision not to marry, and there is no sense of urgency, and he can control his passions, he will do well if he does not marry her.
\v 38 So the one who marries his fiancée does well, and the one who chooses not to marry will do even better. 

\s5
\v 39 A woman is bound to her husband for as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry whomever she wishes to marry, but only in the Lord.
\v 40 Yet in my judgment she would be happier if she lives as she is. And I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
