\s5
\c 35
\p
\v 1 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said, 
\v 2 “Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it.
\v 3 Say to it, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will strike you with my hand and make you a desolation and a horror.
 
\s5
\v 4 I will make your cities ruins, and you yourself will become desolate; then you will know that I am Yahweh.
\v 5 Because you have always been hostile to the people of Israel, and because you poured them out into the hands of the sword at the time of their distress, at the time their punishment was at its greatest—
\v 6 therefore, as I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—I will prepare you for bloodshed, and bloodshed will chase after you! Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.
 
\s5
\v 7 I will make Mount Seir a desolation—a desolation when I cut off from it anyone who passes through and returns again.
\v 8 And I will fill its mountains with its dead. Your high hills and valleys and all of your streams—those killed by the sword will fall in them.
\v 9 I will make you a perpetual desolation. Your cities will not be inhabited, but you will know that I am Yahweh.
 
\s5
\p
\v 10 You have said, “These two nations and these two lands will become mine, and we will possess them,” when Yahweh was present with them.
\v 11 Therefore, as I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—So I will do according to your anger and according to your jealousy that you had in your hatred of Israel, and I will show myself to them when I judge you.

\s5
\v 12 So you will know that I am Yahweh! I have heard all of your contempt when you spoke against the mountains of Israel and said, “They are desolate! They have been given to us to devour.”
\v 13 I heard you when you boasted against me with your mouth; you said many things against me. I heard them.
 
\s5
\p
\v 14 The Lord Yahweh says this: I will make you a desolation, while the entire earth rejoices.
\v 15 As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the people of Israel because of its desolation, I will do the same to you. You will become a desolation, Mount Seir, and all of Edom—all of it! Then they will know that I am Yahweh!’”
