\v 1 When the wall was finished and I had set up the doors in place, and the gatekeepers and singers and Levites were appointed,
\v 2 I gave my brother Hanani charge over Jerusalem, along with Hananiah who had oversight of the citadel, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many. 

\s5
\v 3 And I said to them, "Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are on guard, you may shut the doors and bar them. Appoint guards from those who live in Jerusalem, some at the place of their guard station, and some in front of their own homes." 
\v 4 Now the city was wide and large, but there were few people within it, and no houses had yet been rebuilt.
