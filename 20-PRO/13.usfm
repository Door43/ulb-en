\q
\v 1 A wise son hears his fatherâ€™s instruction,

\q
\v 2 From the fruit of his mouth a person enjoys good things,

\q
\v 3 The one who guards his mouth protects his life,
\q but the one who opens wide his lips will ruin himself.
\q
\v 4 The appetite of lazy people craves but gets nothing,
\q but the appetite of diligent people will be richly satisfied.

\q
\v 5 The one who does right hates lies,
\q but a wicked person makes himself repugnant, and he does what is shameful.

\q but wickedness turns away those who commit sin.

\v 7 There is someone who enriches himself, but has nothing at all,
\q and there is someone who gives everything away, yet is truly wealthy.

\q but for those who listen to good advice there is wisdom.

\v 12 When hope is postponed, it breaks the heart,
\q but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.

\s5
\q
\v 13 The one who scorns instruction will still be subject to it,
\q but the one who honors the command will be rewarded.
\q
\v 14 The teaching of a wise person is a fountain of life,
\q  turning you away from the snares of death.

\s5
\q
\v 15 Good insight wins favor,
\q but the way of the treacherous is never-ending.
\q

\v 23 An unplowed field owned by the poor could produce much food,

\q but one who loves his child is careful to discipline him.

\s5
\q
\v 25 The one who does right eats until he satisfies his appetite, 
\q but the stomach of the wicked is always hungry.
