\p
\v 1 The proverbs of Solomon, the king of Israel, who was the son of David.
\q
\v 2 These proverbs are to teach wisdom and instruction,
\q to teach words of insight,
\q
\v 3 that you may receive correction in order to live
\q by doing what is right, just, and fair.

\s5
\q
\v 4 These proverbs are also to give wisdom to those who have not been taught,
\q and to give knowledge and discretion to young people.
\q
\v 5 Let  wise people listen and increase their learning,
\q and let discerning people get guidance,
\q
\v 6 to understand proverbs,  sayings,
\q and words of wise people and their riddles.
\b

\s5
\q
\v 7 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge—
\q fools despise wisdom and discipline.
\q
\v 8 My son, hear the instruction of your father,
\q and do not lay aside the rules of your mother;
\q
\v 9 they will  be a graceful wreath for your head
\q and pendants hanging from your neck.

\s5
\q
\v 10 My son, if sinners try to entice you into their sin,
\q refuse to follow them.
\q
\v 11 If they say, "Come with us,
\q let us lie in wait to commit murder,
\q let us hide and attack innocent people for no reason.

\s5
\q
\v 12 Let us swallow them up alive, like sheol takes away those who are healthy,
\q and make them like those who fall into the pit.
\q
\v 13 We shall find all kinds of valuable things;
\q we will fill our houses with what we steal from others.
\q
\v 14 Throw in your lot with us;
\q we will all have one purse together."

\s5
\q
\v 15 My son, do not walk down that road with them;
\q do not let your foot touch where they walk;
\q
\v 16 their feet run to evil
\q and they hurry to shed blood.
\q
\v 17 For it is useless to spread the net to trap a bird
\q while the bird is watching.

\s5
\q
\v 18 These men lie in wait to kill themselves—
\q they set a trap for themselves.
\q
\v 19 So are the ways of everyone who gains riches by injustice;
\q unjust gain takes away the lives of those who hold on to it.

\s5
\q
\v 20 Wisdom cries aloud in the street,
\q she raises her voice in the open places;
\q
\v 21 at the head of the noisy streets she cries out, 
\q  at the entrance of the city gates she speaks, 
\q
\v 22 "How long, you who have no wisdom, will you love what you do not understand?
\q How long, you mockers, will you delight in mockery,
\q and how long, you fools, will you hate knowledge?

\s5
\q
\v 23 Pay attention to my rebuke;
\q I will pour out my thoughts to you;
\q I will make my words known to you.
\q
\v 24 I have called, and you have refused to listen;
\q I reached out with my hand, but no one paid attention.
\q
\v 25 But you have ignored all my instruction
\q and paid no attention to my reproof.

\s5
\q
\v 26 I will laugh at your calamity,
\q I will mock you when the terror comes—
\q
\v 27 when your fearful dread comes like a storm
\q and disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind,
\q when distress and anguish come upon you.

\s5
\q
\v 28 Then they will call upon me, and I will not answer;
\q they will desperately call for me, but they will not find me.
\q
\v 29 Because they hate knowledge
\q and did not choose the fear of Yahweh,
\q
\v 30 they would not follow my instruction,
\q and they despised all my corrections.

\s5
\q
\v 31 They will eat the fruit of their ways,
\q and with the fruit of their schemes they will be filled.
\q
\v 32 Those who have not been taught are killed when they turn away,
\q and the indifference of fools will destroy them.
\q
\v 33 But whoever listens to me will live in safety 
\q and will rest secure with no fear of disaster."
