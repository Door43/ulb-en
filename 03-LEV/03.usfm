\v 3 The man will offer the sacrifice of a fellowship offering by fire to Yahweh. The fat that covers or is connected to the inner parts, 
\v 4 and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the loins, and the lobe of  the liver, with the kidneys—he will remove all of this.
\v 5 Aaron’s sons will burn that on the altar with the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire. This will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh; it will be an offering made to him by fire.
