\c 19

\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 "Speak to all the assembly of the people of Israel and say to them, 'You must be holy, for I Yahweh your God am holy.
\v 3 Everyone must respect his mother and his father, and you must keep my Sabbaths. I am Yahweh your God.
\v 4 Do not turn to worthless idols, nor make for yourselves gods out of metal. I am Yahweh your God.

\s5
\p
\v 5 When you offer a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to Yahweh, you must offer it that you may be accepted.
\v 6 It must be eaten the same day you offer it, or on the next day. If  anything remains until the third day, it must be burned.
\v 7 If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is defiled. It must not be accepted, 
\v 8 but everyone who eats it must carry his own guilt because he has desecrated what is holy to Yahweh. That person must be cut off from his people.

\s5
\p
\v 9 When you reap the harvest of your land, you must not completely reap the corners of your field, neither will you gather all the produce of your harvest.

\s5
\p

\p
\v 16 Do not walk around spreading false gossip among your people, but seek to protect your neighbor's life. I  am Yahweh.

\s5

\p
\v 21 A man must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh to the entrance to the tent of meetingâ€”a ram as a guilt offering.
\v 22 Then the priest will make atonement for him with the ram for the guilt offering before Yahweh, for the sin that he has committed. Then the sin which he has committed will be forgiven.

\s5
\p
\v 23 When you come into the land and have planted all kinds of trees for food, then you must regard the fruit they produce as forbidden to be eaten. The fruit must be forbidden to you for three years. It must not be eaten.
\v 24 But in the fourth year all the fruit will be holy, an offering of praise to Yahweh.
\v 25 In the fifth you may eat the fruit, having waited so that the trees might produce more. I am Yahweh your God.

\v 33 If a foreigner lives among you in your land, you must not do him any wrong.
\v 34 The foreigner who lives with you must be to you like the native-born Israelite who lives among you, and you must love him as yourself, because you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.

\s5
\p
\v 35 Do not use false measures when measuring length, weight, or quantity.

\v 37 You must obey all my decrees and all my laws, and do them. I am Yahweh.'"
