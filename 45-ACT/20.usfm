\c 20
\p
\v 1 After the uproar was over, Paul sent for the disciples and encouraged them. Then he said farewell to them and left to go into Macedonia. 
\v 2 When he had gone through those regions and had encouraged the believers very much, he went into Greece. 
\v 3 After he had spent three months there, a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria, so he decided to return through Macedonia.

\s5
\v 4 Accompanying him as far as Asia were Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus; Aristarchus and Secundus, both from the Thessalonian believers; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia.
\v 5 But these men had gone before us and were waiting for us at Troas.
\v 6 We sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and in five days we came to them in Troas. There we stayed for seven days.

\s5
\p
\v 7 On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul spoke to the believers. He was planning to leave the next day, so he kept speaking until midnight.  
\v 8 There were many lamps in the upper room  where we had come together.

\s5
\v 9 In the window was sitting a young man named Eutychus, who fell into a deep sleep. As  Paul spoke even longer, this young man, still sleeping, fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.
\v 10 But Paul went down, stretched himself out on him, and embraced him. Then he said, " Do not be upset any more, for he is alive."

\s5
\v 11 Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking with them much longer until dawn, he left.
\v 12 They brought back the boy alive and were very much comforted. 

\s5
\p
\v 13 We ourselves went ahead of Paul by ship and sailed away to Assos, where we planned to take Paul on board. This is what he himself desired to do, because he planned to go by land.
\v 14 When he met us at Assos, we took him onto the ship and went to Mitylene.

\s5
\v 15 Then we sailed from there and arrived the next day opposite the island of Chios. The following day we touched at the island of Samos, and the day after we came to the city of Miletus.
\v 16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not spend any time in Asia; for he was hurrying  to be in Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost, if it were at all possible for him to do so.

\s5
\p
\v 17 From Miletus he sent men to Ephesus and called to himself the elders of the church.
\v 18 When they had come to him, he said to them,
\p "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I always spent my time with you.
\v 19 I kept serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind and with tears, and in sufferings that happened to me because of the plots of the Jews.
\v 20 You know how I did not keep back from declaring to you anything that was useful, and how I taught you in public and also going from house to house. 
\v 21 You know how I kept warning both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.

\s5
\v 22 And now, look, I go bound in the Holy Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there,
\v 23 except that the Holy Spirit witnesses to me in every city and says that chains and sufferings await me. 
\v 24 But I do not consider that my life is in any way precious to myself, so that I may finish my race and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to bear witness to the gospel of the grace of God.

\s5
\v 25 And now, look, I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will see my face no more.
\v 26 Therefore I testify to you this day, that I am innocent of the blood of any man.
\v 27 For I did not keep back from declaring to you the whole will of God.

\s5
\v 28 Therefore be careful about yourselves, and about all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be careful to shepherd the assembly of the Lord, which he purchased with his own blood.
\v 29 I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, and not spare the flock.
\v 30 I know that from even among your own selves some men shall come and say corrupt things, in order to draw away the disciples after them. 


\s5
\v 31 So be on guard. Remember that for three years I did not stop instructing every one of you with tears night and day.
\v 32 And now I entrust you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all the ones who are set apart.

\s5
\v 33 I coveted no man’s silver, gold, or clothing.
\v 34 You yourselves know that these hands served my own needs and the needs of those who were with me. 
\v 35 In all things I gave you an example of how you should help the weak by working, and of how you should remember the words of the Lord Jesus, words that he himself said: "It is more blessed to give than to receive."

\s5
\p
\v 36 After he had spoken in this way, he knelt  down and prayed with them all.
\v 37 They all cried very much and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him.
\v 38 They were sad most of all because of what he had said, that they would never see his face again. Then they escorted him to the ship.
