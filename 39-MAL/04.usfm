\v 1 For see, the day is coming, burning like a furnace, when all the proud and all the evildoers will become stubble.
The day that is coming will burn them up," says Yahweh of hosts, "so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.
\v 2 But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. You will go out, and you will leap like calves from the stall.
\v 3 And you will trample down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I act," says Yahweh of hosts.

\v 4 "Remember the teaching of my servant Moses that I gave him at Horeb in front of all Israel, the statutes and the rulings.
\v 5 See, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and fearful day of Yahweh.
\v 6 He will turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, so that I do not come and attack the land with complete destruction."
