\v 1 But you, say what fits with faithful instruction.
\v 2 Older men must be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance.

\s5
\v 3 Older women likewise should always present themselves as reverent, not gossips. They should not be enslaved to much wine. They should teach what is good
\v 4 in order to train the younger women to sensibly love their own husbands and children.
\v 5 They should train them to be sensible, pure, good housekeepers, and obedient to their own husbands. They should do these things so that God's word may not be insulted.

\s5
\v 6 In the same way, encourage the younger men to use good sense.
\v 7 In all ways present yourself as an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, dignity,
\v 8 and words that are above criticism, so that anyone who oppose you may be ashamed because they had nothing bad to say about us.
\s5
\v 9 Slaves are to obey their masters in all things. They are to please them and not argue with them.
\v 10 They should not steal from them, but demonstrating all good faith, so that in every way they may bring credit to the teaching about God our Savior.

\s5
\v 11 For the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all people.
\v 12 It trains us to deny ungodliness and worldly passions. It trains us to live sensibly, righteously, and in a godly way in this age
\v 13 while we look forward to receiving our blessed hope, the appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.

\s5
\v 14 Jesus gave himself for us in order to redeem us from all lawlessness and to make pure, for himself, a special people who are eager to do good works.

\v 15 Speak of and encourage these things. Give correction with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
