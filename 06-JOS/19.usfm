\v 9 The inheritance of the tribe of Simeon formed part of the territory of the tribe  of Judah. Because the portion of land assigned to the tribe of Judah was too large for them, the tribe of Simeon received their inheritance out of the middle of their portion.

\v 27 Then it turned eastward to Beth Dagon and went as far as Zebulun, and then to the valley of Iphtahel, northward to Bethemek and Neiel. Then it continued on to Cabul toward the north.
\v 28 It then went on to Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon.

\s5

\v 34 The border turned westward to Aznothtabor and went on to Hukkok; it touched Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west and Judah on the east at the Jordan River.

\v 47 When the territory of the tribe of Dan was lost to them, Dan attacked Leshem, fought against it, and captured it. They killed everyone with the sword, took possession of it, and settled in it. They renamed Leshem, calling it Dan after their ancestor.
\v 48 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Dan, and it was given to their clans—the cities, including their villages.

\s5
\p
\v 49 When they finished the allocation of the land as inheritance, the people of Israel gave an inheritance among themselves to Joshua, the son of Nun.
\v 50 By command of Yahweh they gave him the city for which he asked, Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim. He rebuilt the city and lived there.

\s5
\p
\v 51 These are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the tribal leaders of their ancestors' families within the people of Israel, assigned by lot at Shiloh, before Yahweh, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. So they finished assigning the land.
