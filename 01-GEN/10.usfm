\v 8  Cush became the father of Nimrod, who was the first conqueror on the earth.
\v 9 He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. That is why it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh."
\v 10 The first centers of his kingdom were Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

\s5
\v 11 Out of that land he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,

\v 19 The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, in the direction of Gerar, as far as Gaza, and as one goes toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.

\v 23 The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshech.

\v 24 Arpachshad became the father of Shelah, and Shelah became the father of Eber.
\v 25  Eber had two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brotherâ€™s name was Joktan.

\v 26  Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
\v 27  Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
\v 28  Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
