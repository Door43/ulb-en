\c 10
\p
\v 1 For the law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not those realities themselves. The law can never make perfect those who draw near to God by means of the same sacrifices that the priests continually offer year after year.
\v 2 Or else would not those sacrifices have ceased to be offered? In that case the worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more awareness of sins.
\v 3 But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins committed year after year.
\v 4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

\s5
\v 5 When Christ came into the world, he said,
\q "You did not desire sacrifices or offerings.
\q Instead, you prepared a body for me.
\q
\v 6 You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings or sacrifices for sin. 
\q
\v 7 Then I said, "See, here I am to do your will, God, as it is written about me in the scroll."
\q 

\s5
\p
\v 8 He said as is stated above: "You did not desire sacrifices, offerings, or whole burnt offerings for sin, nor did you take pleasure in them"—sacrifices that are offered according to the law.
\v 9 Then he said, "See, I am here to do your will." He sets aside the first practice in order to establish the second.
\v 10 In the second practice, we have been sanctified by God's will through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

\s5
\v 11 Indeed, every priest stands day by day serving, offering the same sacrifices, which, however, can never take away sins.
\v 12 But after Christ offered one sacrifice for sins forever, he sat down at the right side of God,
\v 13 waiting until his enemies were humbled and made a stool for his feet.
\v 14 For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified.
 
\s5
\v 15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us. For first he said,
\q
\v 16 " 'This is the covenant that I will make with them
\q after those days,' says the Lord:
\q 'I will put my laws in their hearts,
\q and I will write them on their minds.' "

\s5
\q
\v 17 Then he said, "No more will I remember their sins and acts of lawlessness."
\p
\v 18 Now where there is forgiveness for these things, there offerings are no longer made for sin.

\s5
\p
\v 19 Therefore, brothers, we have confidence to enter into the most holy place by Jesus' blood.
\v 20 That is the way that he has opened for us by means of his body, a new and living way through the curtain.
\v 21 And because we have a great priest over the house of God,
\v 22 let us draw near with a true heart in the full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and having our body washed with pure water.

\s5
\v 23 Let us also hold tightly to the confession of our confident expectation, without wavering, because God who has promised is faithful.
\v 24 Let us consider how to motivate one another to love and good deeds.
\v 25 Let us not stop assembling together, as some have done. Instead, encourage one another more and more, as you see the day drawing near.

\s5
\p
\v 26 For if we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, a sacrifice for sins no longer exists.
\v 27 Instead, there is only a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierce fire that will consume God's enemies.

\s5
\v 28 Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses.
\v 29 How much more punishment do you think anyone deserves who has trampled on the Son of God, anyone who has treated the blood of the covenant as something unholy, the blood by which he was sanctified—anyone who has insulted the Spirit of grace?

\s5
\v 30 For we know the one who said, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will pay back." And again, "The Lord will judge his people."
\v 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God!

\s5
\p
\v 32 But remember the former days, after you were enlightened—how you endured a great agony of suffering.
\v 33 You were exposed to public ridicule by insults and persecution, and you were participants with those who went through such suffering.
\v 34 For you had compassion on those who were prisoners, and you accepted with joy the seizure of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves had a better and everlasting possession.

\s5
\v 35 So do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.
\v 36 For you need patience, so that you may receive what God has promised, after you have done his will.
\q
\v 37 "For in a very little while,
\q the one who is coming will indeed come and not delay.

\s5
\q
\v 38 My righteous one will live by faith.
\q If he turns back, I will not be pleased with him."
\p
\v 39 But we are not some of those who turn back to destruction. Instead, we are some of those who have faith for keeping our soul.
