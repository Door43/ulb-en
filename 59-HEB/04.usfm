\c 4
\p
\v 1 Therefore, we must be very careful so that none of you might seem to have failed to reach the continuing promise to enter God's rest.
\v 2 For we have had the good news about God's rest proclaimed to us just as the Israelites had, but that message did not benefit those who heard it without joining faith to it.

\s5
\v 3 For we, the ones who have believedâ€”we are the ones who will enter that rest, just as it says:
\q "As I swore in my wrath,
\q They will not enter my rest."
\p He said this, even though his created works had been finished from the beginning of the world.
\v 4 For he has said somewhere concerning the seventh day, 
\q "God rested on the seventh day from all his deeds."
\v 5 Again he has said,
\q "They will not enter my rest."

\s5
\p
\v 6 Therefore, since God's rest is still reserved for some to enter, and since many Israelites who heard the good news about his rest did not enter because of disobedience, 
\v 7 God has again set a certain day, called "Today." He fixed this day when he spoke through David, who said long after it had first been said,
\q "Today if you will listen to his voice,
\q do not harden your hearts."
 
\s5
\p
\v 8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken about another day.
\v 9 Therefore there is still a sabbath rest reserved for God's people.
\v 10 For he who enters God's rest has himself also rested from his deeds, as God did from his.
\v 11 Therefore let us be eager to enter that rest, so that no one will fall in the kind of disobedience that they did.

\s5
\v 12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. It pierces even to dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow. It is able to discern the heart's thoughts and intentions.
\v 13 No created thing is hidden from God's sight. Instead, everything is bare and open to the eyes of the one to whom we must give account.

\s5
\p
\v 14 Having then a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us firmly hold to our beliefs.
\v 15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot feel sympathy for our weaknesses, but one who has in all ways been tempted as we are, except that he is without sin.
\v 16 Let us then come up with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
