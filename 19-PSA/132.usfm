\s5
\c 132
\d A song of ascents.
\b
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, for David's sake call to mind 
\q all his afflictions.
\q
\v 2 Call to mind how he swore to Yahweh,
\q how he vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 He said, "I will not enter my house
\q or get into my bed,
\q
\v 4 I will not give sleep to my eyes
\q or rest to my eyelids
\q
\v 5 until I find a place for Yahweh,
\q a tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob."
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 See, we heard about it in Ephrathah;
\q we found it in the fields of Jaar.
\q
\v 7 We will go into God's tabernacle;
\q we will worship at his footstool.
\q
\v 8 Arise, Yahweh; come to your resting place.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 May your priests be clothed with integrity;
\q may your faithful ones shout for joy.
\q
\v 10 For your servant Davidâ€™s sake,
\q do not turn away from your anointed king.
 
\s5
\q
\v 11 Yahweh swore to be trustworthy to David;
\q he will not turn back from his oath:
\q "I will place one of your descendants on your throne.
\q
\v 12 If your sons keep my covenant
\q and the laws that I will teach them,
\q their children also will sit on your throne forevermore."
 
\s5
\q
\v 13 Certainly Yahweh has chosen Zion;
\q he has desired her for his seat.
\q
\v 14 This is my resting place forever;
\q I will live here, for I desire her.
 
\s5
\q
\v 15 I will abundantly bless her with provisions;
\q I will satisfy her poor with bread.
\q
\v 16 I will clothe her priests with salvation;
\q her faithful ones will shout aloud for joy.
 
\s5
\q
\v 17 There I will make the horn of David to grow;
\q I have placed a lamp there for my anointed one.
\q
\v 18 I will clothe his enemies with shame,
\q but his crown will shine.
