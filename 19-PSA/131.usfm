\s5
\c 131
\p
\d A song of ascents; of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, my heart is not proud or my eyes haughty.
\q I do not have great hopes for myself
\q or concern myself with things that are beyond me.
 
\s5
\q
\v 2 Indeed I have stilled and quieted my soul;
\q like a weaned child with his mother,
\q my soul within me is like a weaned child.
\q
\v 3 Israel, hope in Yahweh
\q now and forever.
