\s5
\c 92
\d A psalm, a song for the sabbath day.
\b
\q
\v 1 It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh
\q and to sing praises to your name, Most High,
\q
\v 2 to proclaim your covenant faithfulness in the morning
\q and your truthfulness every night,
\q
\v 3 with a harp of ten strings 
\q and with the melody of the lyre.
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your deeds.
\q I will sing for joy because of  the deeds of your hands.
\q
\v 5 How great are your deeds, Yahweh!
\q Your thoughts are very deep.
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 A brutish person does not know,
\q nor does a fool understand this:
\q
\v 7 When the wicked sprout like the grass,
\q and even when all the evildoers thrive,
\q still they are doomed to eternal destruction.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 But you, Yahweh, will reign forever.
\q
\v 9 Indeed, look at your enemies, Yahweh;
\q all the evildoers are scattered.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 You have exalted my horn like the horn of the wild ox;
\q I am anointed with fresh oil.
\q
\v 11 My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies;
\q my ears have heard of the doom of my evil foes.
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 The righteous will flourish like the palm tree;
\q they will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
\q
\v 13 They are planted in the house of Yahweh;
\q they flourish in the courts of our God.
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 They bear fruit even when they are old;
\q they stay fresh and green,
\q
\v 15 to proclaim that Yahweh is just.
\q He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
