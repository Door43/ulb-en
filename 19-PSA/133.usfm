\d A song of ascents, of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
\q for brothers to live together!
 
\s5
\q
\v 2 It is like fine oil on the head
\q pouring down on the beard—
\q Aaron's beard,
\q and then it pours down on the collar of his robes.
\q
\v 3 It is like the dew of Hermon
\q which falls on the mountains of Zion.
\q For there Yahweh commanded the blessing—
\q life forevermore.
