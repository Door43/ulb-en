\s5
\c 133
\d A song of ascents, of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
\q for brothers to remain together in unity!
 
\s5
\q
\v 2 It is like the precious oil on the head
\q that flowed down the beard,
\q Aaronâ€™s beard,
\q that flowed down his garments.
\q
\v 3 It like the dew of Hermon,
\q which comes down upon the mountains of Zion.
\q For there Yahweh decreed the blessing,
\q life forevermore.
