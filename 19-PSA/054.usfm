\v 1 Save me, God, by your name,
\q and judge me in your might.
\q
\v 2 Hear my prayer, God;
\q give ear to the words of my mouth.
\q
\v 3 For strangers have risen up against me,
\q and pitiless men have sought after my life;
\q they have not set God before them.

\v 4 See, God is my helper;
\q the Lord is the one who upholds me.

\v 6 I will sacrifice to you with a freewill offering;
\q I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is good.

\q my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.
