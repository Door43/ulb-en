\q
\v 52 I have thought about your righteous decrees from ancient times, Yahweh,
\q and I comfort myself.

\q
\v 84 How long must your servant endure this;

\q
\v 108 Yahweh, please accept the freewill offerings of my mouth,
\q and teach me your righteous decrees.

\s5
\q

\v 124 Show your servant your covenant faithfulness,
\q and teach me your statutes.

\s5
\q
\v 125 I am your servant; give me understanding
\q so that I may know your covenant decrees.
\q
\v 126 It is time for Yahweh to act,
\q for people have broken your law.

\s5
\q
\v 127 Truly I love your commandments
\q more than gold, more than fine gold.

\s5
\q
\v 139 Anger has destroyed me
\q because my adversaries forget your words.
\q
\v 140 Your word has been tested very much,
\q and your servant loves it.

\s5

\q
\v 161 Princes persecute me without cause;
\q my heart trembles, afraid of disobeying your word.
\q
\v 162 I rejoice at your word
\q like one who finds great plunder.

\s5
\q
\v 163 I hate and despise falsehood,
