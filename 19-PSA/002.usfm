\q
\v 1 Why are the nations in rebellion,
\q and the peoples conspire in vain ?
\q
\v 2 The kings of the earth take their stand together
\q and the rulers conspire together
\q against Yahweh and against his Messiah, saying,
\q
\v 3 "Let us tear off the shackles they put on us
\q and throw off their chains."

\s5
\q
\v 4 He who sits in the heavens will sneer at them;
\q the Lord mocks them.
\q
\v 5 Then he will speak to them in his anger
\q and terrify them in his rage, saying,

\s5
\q
\v 6 "I myself have anointed my king
\q on Zion, my holy mountain."
\q
\v 7 I will announce a decree of Yahweh.
\q He said to me, "You are my son!
\q This day I have become your father.

\s5
\q
\v 8 Ask  me, and I will give you the nations for your inheritance
\q and the farthermost regions of the earth for your possession.
\q
\v 9 You will break them with an iron scepter;
\q you will smash like a potterâ€™s jar."
\b

\s5
\q
\v 10 So now, you kings, be warned;
\q be corrected, you rulers of the earth.
\q
\v 11 Worship Yahweh in fear
\q and rejoice with trembling.

\s5
\q
\v 12 Give true allegiance to his son so that he will not be angry with you, and so you will not die
\q when his anger quickly ignites.
\q Blessed are all those who take shelter in him.
