\c 57
\m
\d For the chief musician; set to Al Tashheth. A psalm
of David. A michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave.
\q
\v 1 Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me,
\q for I take refuge in you until these troubles are over.
\q I stay under your wings for protection until this destruction is over.

\s5
\q
\v 2 I will cry to God Most High,
\q to God, who does all things for me.
\q
\v 3 He will send help from heaven and save me,
\q he is angry with those who crush me.
\qs Selah\qs*
\q God will send me his loving kindness and his faithfulness.

\s5
\q
\v 4 My life is among lions;
\q I am among those who are ready to devour me.
\q I am among people whose teeth are spears and arrows,
\q and whose tongues are sharp swords.
\q
\v 5 Be exalted, God, above the heavens;
\q let your glory be above all the earth.

\s5
\q
\v 6 They spread out a net for my feet;
\q I was distressed.
\q They dug a pit in front of me.
\q They themselves have fallen into the middle of it!
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 7 My heart is fixed, God, my heart is fixed;
\q I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.
\q
\v 8 Wake up, my honored heart; wake up, lute and harp;
\q I will wake up the dawn.

\s5
\q
\v 9 I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples;
\q I will sing praises to you among the nations.
\q
\v 10 For great is your unfailing love, reaching to the heavens;
\q and your faithfulness to the clouds.
\q
\v 11 Be exalted, God, above the heavens;
\q may your glory be exalted over all the earth.
