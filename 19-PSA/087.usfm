\v 1 On the holy mount stands the city he founded;
\q
\v 2 Yahweh loves the gates of Zion
\q more than all the tents of Jacob.
\q
\v 3 Glorious things are said of you, city of God.

\s5
\q
\v 4 "I mention Rahab and Babylon to my followers.
\q See, there are Philistia, and Tyre, along with Ethiopiaâ€”
\q and will say, 'This one was born there.'"

\s5
\q
\v 5 Of Zion it will be said,
"Each of these was born in her;
\q and the Most High himself will establish her."
\q
\v 6 Yahweh writes in the census book of the nations,
\q "This one was born there."
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 7 So also the singers and the dancers say together,
\q "All my fountains are in you."
