\s5
\c 32
\d A psalm of David. A maschil.
\b
\q
\v 1 Blessed is the person whose transgression is forgiven,
\q whose sin is covered.
\q
\v 2 Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh reckons no guilt
\q and in whose spirit there is no deceit.

\s5
\q
\v 3 When I remained silent, my bones were wasting away
\q while I groaned all day long.
\q
\v 4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
\q My strength withered as in summer drought.
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you,
\q and I no longer hid my iniquity.
\q I said, "I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh,"
\q and you forgave the guilt of my sin. 
\qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 Because of this, all who are godly should pray to you at a time of great distress.
\q Then when the surging waters overflow, they will not reach those people.

\s5
\q
\v 7 You are my hiding place; you will guard me from trouble.
\q You will surround me with the songs of victory. 
\qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go.
\q I will instruct you with my eye upon you.

\s5
\q
\v 9 Do not be like a horse or like a mule, which have no understanding;
\q it is only with bridle and bit to control them
\q that they will go where you want them to.
\q
\v 10 The wicked have many sorrows,
\q but Yahweh's covenant faithfulness will surround the one who trusts in him.

\s5
\q
\v 11 Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous;
\q shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart.
