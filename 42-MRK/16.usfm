\v 4 When they looked up, they saw that someone had rolled away the stone, which was very large.

\v 5 They entered the tomb and saw a young man dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side, and they were astonished.
\v 6 He said to them, "Do not be afraid. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. Look at the place where they had laid him.
\v 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you."
