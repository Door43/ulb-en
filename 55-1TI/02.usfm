\s5
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Therefore first of all, I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,
\v 2 for kings and all who are in authority, in order that we may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
\v 3 This is good and acceptable before God our Savior.
\v 4 He desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

\s5
\v 5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus,
\v 6 who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony at the right time.
\v 7 For this purpose, I, myself, was made a herald and an apostle. I speak truth; I do not lie. I am a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Therefore, I want men in every place to pray and to lift up holy hands without wrath and doubts.
\v 9 Likewise, I want the women to dress themselves in proper clothing, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or expensive clothing,
\v 10 but with what is appropriate to women who profess godliness through good works.

\s5
\v 11 A woman should learn in silence and in all compliance.
\v 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to be in silence.

\s5
\v 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
\v 14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman became completely deceived in transgression.
\v 15 However, she will be saved through bearing children, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with soundness of mind.
