\c 5
\p
\v 1 Do not scold an older man, but exhort him as if he were a father, and exhort younger men as if they were brothers.
\v 2 Exhort older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters in all purity.

\s5
\v 3 Honor widows, the real widows; 
\v 4 but if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show honor in their own household and repay their parents, because this is pleasing to God.

\s5
\v 5 But a real widow is left all alone and puts her confidence in God, she always waits before him with requests and prayers both night and day.
\v 6 However, the woman who lives for pleasure is dead, even though she is still alive.

\s5
\v 7  And preach these things so that they may be beyond reproach.
\v 8 But if someone does not provide for his own relatives, especially for those of his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

\s5
\v 9 Let a widow be enrolled as a widow who is not younger in years than sixty, a wife of one husband.
\v 10 She must be known for good deeds, whether it is that she has cared for children, or has been  hospitable to strangers, or has washed the feet of the saints, or has relieved the afflicted, or has followed every good work.

\s5
\v 11 But as for younger widows, refuse to enroll them in the list, because when they are overcome by bodily desires against Christ, they want to marry.
\v 12 In this way they incur guilt because they revoke their prior commitment.
\v 13 Also, they become accustomed to being idle, going around from house to house. Not only do they become idle, but they also become gossips and meddlesome, saying things they should not say.

\s5
\v 14 I therefore want younger women to marry, to bear children, to manage the house, to give the adversary no opportunity to accuse us of doing evil.
\v 15 For some have already turned aside after Satan.
\v 16 If any believing  woman has widows, let her help them, so that the church be not burdened, so that it might help the real widows.

\s5
\p
\v 17 Let the elders who lead well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work with the word and in teaching.
\v 18 For the scripture says, "You shall not put a muzzle on an ox while it treads the grain," and "The laborer is worthy of his wages."

\s5
\v 19 Do not receive an accusation against an elder unless there are two or three witnesses.
\v 20 Reprove sinners in the sight of all so that the rest may be afraid.

\s5
\v 21 I solemnly command you in the sight of God, of Christ Jesus, and of the chosen angels, that you keep these rules without bias, and that you do nothing out of favoritism.
\v 22 Place hands hastily upon no one, neither share in the sins belonging to another person. You should keep yourself pure.

\s5
\v 23 You should no longer drink water, but rather you should take a little wine for the stomach and your frequent sicknesses.
\v 24 The sins of some people are openly known, and they go before them into judgment. But some follow later.
\v 25 Likewise, some good works are openly known, but even the others cannot be hidden.
