\v 1 Now the Spirit clearly says that in later times some people will leave the faith and pay attention to deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons
\v 2 through lying hypocrisy, their own consciences branded. 

\s5
\v 3 They will forbid to marry and to receive foods that God created for sharing with thanksgiving among believers who came to know the truth.
\v 4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing that we take with thanksgiving is rejected,
\v 5 since it is consecrated through the word of God and prayer.

\v 6 If you place these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ because you are being nourished by the words of faith and by the good teaching that you have followed.
\v 7 But do not accept profane stories loved by old women, but train yourself in godliness.
\v 8 For bodily training is only a little useful, but godliness is useful for all things and holds promise for this life now and the life to come.

\s5
\v 9 This message is trustworthy and worth full acceptance.
\v 10 For it is for this that we struggle and work very hard, because we have confidence in the living God, who is the savior of all people, but especially of  believers.

\s5
\v 11 Proclaim and teach these things.
\v 12 Let no one look down on you because you are young. Instead, set an example for those who believe, in speech,  conduct, love, faithfulness, and purity.
\v 13 Until I come, attend to the reading, to the exhortation, and to the teaching.

\s5
\v 14 Do not neglect the gift that is in you, that was given to you through prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders.
\v 15 Care for these things, be in them, so that your progress may appear to all people.
\v 16 Give careful attention to yourself and to the teaching. Continue in these things because by doing that you will save yourself and those who listen to you.
