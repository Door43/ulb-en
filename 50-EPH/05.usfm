\c 5
\p
\v 1 Therefore become imitators of God, as his beloved children,
\v 2 and live in love as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as an  offering and sacrifice, a pleasing aroma to God.

\s5
\p
\v 3 Sexual immorality or any impurity or sensual greed must not be suggested among you, as is proper for those set apart for God—
\v 4 nor obscenity, foolish talk, or degrading jokes, which are improper, but rather thankfulness.

\s5
\v 5 For you can be certain that no sexually immoral, impure, or greedy person, that is, one who worships idols, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
\v 6 Let no one deceive you with empty words. Because of these things the anger of God is coming upon the children of disobedience.
\v 7 So do not be participants with them.

\s5
\v 8 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. So walk as children of light—
\v 9 because the fruit of the light is all goodness, righteousness, and truth
\v 10 —showing what is pleasing to the Lord.
\v 11 Have no participation with the unfruitful works of the darkness, but rather expose them,
\v 12 for the things done by them in secret are too shameful even to describe.

\s5
\v 13 Everything is revealed by the light,
\v 14 because the light is shining on it all. Therefore it has been said, 
\q "Awake, you who sleep, 
\q and rise from the dead, 
\q and Christ will shine on you."

\s5
\p
\v 15 Therefore be careful how you live, not as unwise people but as wise.
\v 16 Redeem the time because the days are evil.
\v 17 Do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.

\s5
\v 18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that leads to ruin, but instead be filled with the Holy Spirit,
\v 19 speaking to each other in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and praising with your heart to the Lord,
\v 20 always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father,
\v 21 subjecting yourselves to one  another in reverence for Christ.

\s5
\p
\v 22 Wives should be subject to their own husbands, as to the Lord.
\v 23 For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, and he is the Savior of the body.
\v 24 But as the church is subject to Christ, so also must wives be to their husbands in everything.

\s5
\v 25 Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her,
\v 26 that he might make her holy because he cleansed us by the washing of water by the word,
\v 27 that he might present to himself the church as glorious, without  stain or wrinkle or any such thing, but instead holy and without fault.

\s5
\v 28 In the same way, husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who  loves his own wife loves himself.
\v 29 No one ever hated his own body, but instead he nourishes and loves it, as Christ also loves the Church,
\v 30 because we are members of his body.

\s5
\v 31 "For this cause a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
\v 32 This is a great hidden truth, but I am speaking about Christ and his church.
\v 33 Nevertheless, each of you also must love his own wife as himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
