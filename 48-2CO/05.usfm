\s5
\c 5
\p
\v 1 We know that if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by human hands, but an eternal house, in heaven.
\v 2 For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling—
\v 3 because by putting it on we will not be found naked.

\s5
\v 4 For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened—not that we want to be unclothed, but wanting to be clothed, so that what is mortal may be absorbed by life.
\v 5 The one who prepared us for this very thing is God, who gave us the Spirit as a pledge of what is to come.

\s5
\v 6 Therefore always be confident; be aware that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord
\v 7 (for we walk by faith, not by sight).
\v 8 So we have confidence; we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.

\s5
\v 9 So we make it our goal, whether we are at home or away, to please him.
\v 10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for the things done in the body, whether for good or for bad.

\s5
\p
\v 11 Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade people. What we are is clearly seen by God, and I expect that it is also clear to your consciences.
\v 12 We are not recommending ourselves to you again, but we are giving you a reason to be proud of us, so you may have an answer for those who boast about appearances but not about what is in the heart.

\s5
\v 13 For if we are out of our minds, it is for God; and if we are in our right minds, it is for your sake.
\v 14 For the love of Christ compels us, because we are certain of this: that one person died for all, and that therefore all have died.
\v 15 And Christ died for all, so that those who live should live no longer for themselves but for him who died and was raised.

\s5
\v 16 For this reason, from now on we do not judge anyone according to human standards, even though we once regarded Christ in this way. But now we do not judge anyone in this way any longer.
\v 17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; see, it has become new.

\s5
\v 18 All these things are from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation;
\v 19 that is, in Christ God is reconciling the world to himself, not counting their sinful stumblings against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.

\s5
\p
\v 20 So we are appointed as representatives of Christ, as though God were making his appeal through us. We plead with you, for the sake of Christ: "Be reconciled to God!"
\v 21 He made Christ become the sacrifice for our sin—the one who never sinned—so that in Christ we might become the righteousness of God.
