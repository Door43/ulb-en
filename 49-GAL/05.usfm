\s5
\c 5
\p
\v 1 It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. So stand firm and do not be entrapped again under a yoke of bondage.
\p
\v 2 Look, I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will not benefit you in any way.

\s5
\v 3 Again, I testify to every man who is circumcised that he becomes obliged to obey the whole law.
\v 4 You are separated from Christ, all you who are justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.

\s5
\v 5 For through the Spirit, by faith, we are waiting for the confidence of righteousness.
\v 6 In Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything. Only faith working through love is what matters.
\v 7 You were running well. Who stopped you from obeying the truth?
\v 8 The persuasion to do that is not from him who calls you.

\s5
\v 9 A little yeast makes the whole lump of dough rise.
\v 10 I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will not think in any other way. He who confuses you will bear his own condemnation, whoever he is.

\s5
\v 11 Brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross would be destroyed.
\v 12 I wish that those who mislead you would castrate themselves.

\s5
\p
\v 13 For God has called you, brothers, to freedom. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. Instead through love serve one another.
\v 14 For the whole law is fulfilled in one commandment; in "You must love your neighbor as yourself."
\v 15 But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not destroyed by one another.

\s5
\p
\v 16 I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh.
\v 17 For the flesh has strong desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit has strong desires against the flesh. For these are opposed to each other. The result is that you do not do the things you desire to do.
\v 18 But if the Spirit is leading you, you are not under the law.

\s5
\v 19 Now the works of the flesh are visible. They are sexual immorality, impurity, lustfulness,
\v 20 idolatry, sorcery, hostility, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, rivalry, dissension, sectarian division,
\v 21 envy, drunkenness, drunken riots, and other things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

\s5
\v 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,
\v 23 gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things.
\v 24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and evil desires.

\s5
\p
\v 25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
\v 26 Let us not become conceited, provoke one another, or envy one another.
