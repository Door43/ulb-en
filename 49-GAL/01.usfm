\s5
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Paul, an apostle—not an apostle from men nor through a man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead ones—
\v 2 and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia:

\s5
\v 3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 4 who gave himself for our sins so that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
\v 5 to him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
\b

\s5
\p
\v 6 I am amazed that you are turning so quickly to a different gospel. I am amazed that you are turning away from him who called you by the grace of Christ.
\v 7 This is not to say that there is another gospel, but there are some men who cause you trouble and want to change the gospel of Christ.

\s5
\v 8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you, let him be cursed.
\v 9 As we have said before, so now I say again, "If someone proclaims to you a gospel other than the one you accepted, let him be cursed."
\v 10 For am I now seeking the approval of men or God? Am I seeking to please men? If I am still trying to please men, I am not a servant of Christ.

\s5
\p
\v 11 For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I proclaimed is not man's.
\v 12 I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it. Instead, it was by revelation of Jesus Christ to me.

\s5
\v 13 You have heard about my former life in Judaism, how I was persecuting the church of God beyond measure and destroying it.
\v 14 I was advancing in Judaism beyond many contemporaries of my own people. I was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.

\s5
\v 15 But God was pleased to choose me from my mother's womb. He called me through his grace
\v 16 to reveal his Son in me, so that I would proclaim him among the Gentiles. I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood
\v 17 and I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me, instead, I went to Arabia and then returned to Damascus.

\s5
\p
\v 18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days.
\v 19 But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.
\v 20 Look, before God, I am not lying in what I write to you.

\s5
\v 21 Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
\v 22 I was still not known by sight to the churches of Judea that were in Christ,
\v 23 but they only heard the report: "The man who once persecuted us now proclaims the faith he once tried to destroy."
\v 24 And they glorified God because of me.
