\v 51 “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘When you cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
\v 52 then you must drive out all the land’s inhabitants before you. You must destroy all their carved figures. You must destroy all their cast figures and demolish all their shrines.
 
\s5
\v 53 You must take possession of the land and settle in it, because I have given you the land to possess.
\v 54 You must inherit the land by lot, according to each clan. To the larger clans you must give a larger share of land, and to the smaller clans you must give a smaller share of land. Wherever the lot falls to each clan, that land will belong to it. You will inherit the land according to your ancestors’ tribes.
 
\s5
\v 55 But if you do not drive out the land’s inhabitants before you, then the people you allow to stay will become like objects in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will make your lives difficult in the land where you settle.
\v 56 Then it will happen that what I now intend to do to those people, I will do also to you.' "
