\v 1 On the day that Moses completed the tabernacle, he anointed it and sanctified it for Yahweh’s use, together with all of its furnishings. He sanctified and anointed the altar and all its utensils. He anointed them and sanctified them.
\v 2 On that day, the leaders of Israel, the heads of their ancestor's families, offered sacrifices. These men were leading the tribes. It was they who had overseen the counting of the men in the census.
\v 3 They brought their offerings before Yahweh. They brought six covered carts and twelve oxen. They brought one cart for every two leaders, and each leader brought one ox. They presented these things in front of the tabernacle.
 
\s5
\v 4 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses. He said,
\v 5 "Accept the offerings from them and use the offerings for the work in the tent of meeting. Give the offerings to the Levites, to each one as his work needs them.”

\v 6 Moses took the carts and the oxen, and he gave them to the Levites.
\v 7  He gave two carts and four oxen to the descendants of Gershon, because of what their work needed.
