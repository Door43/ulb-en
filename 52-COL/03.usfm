\c 3
\p
\v 1 If then God has raised you with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.
\v 2 Think about what is above, not about what is on earth,
\v 3 for you have died and God has hidden your life in Christ.
\v 4 When Christ—your life—is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.
\b

\p
\v 5 Put to death, therefore, your sinful desires of earth—sexual immorality, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry.
\v 6 It is for these things that the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
\v 7 It is in these things that you also once walked when you lived by them.
\v 8 But now you must get rid of all these things—wrath, anger, evil intentions, insults, and shameful, obscene speech from your mouth.

\s5
\v 9 Do not lie to one another, for you have stripped off your old self with its practices,
\v 10 and you have put on your new self, which is being renewed in the knowledge of his image, the image of the one who created your new self.
\v 11 In this knowledge, there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but instead Christ is all things and in all things.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones—holy and beloved—a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, and patience.
\v 13 Bear with one another. Be gracious to each other. If someone has a complaint against someone else, forgive in the same way that the Lord has forgiven you.
\v 14 Above all these things, have love, which is the bond of perfection.

\s5
\v 15 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts. It was into this peace that you were called in one body. And be thankful.
\v 16 Let the word of Christ live in you richly. With all wisdom teach and admonish one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, and sing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.
\v 17 And whatever you may do—in word or in deed—do all in the name of the Lord Jesus and give thanks to God the Father through him.

\s5
\p
\v 18 Wives, submit to your husbands, as it is appropriate in the Lord.
\v 19 Husbands, love your wives, and do not be bitter against them.
\v 20 Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing in the Lord.
\v 21 Fathers, do not provoke your children, so that they will not be discouraged.

\s5
\v 22 Slaves, obey your masters according to the flesh in all things, not with eyeservice as people pleasers, but with a sincere heart that fears the Lord.
\v 23 Whatever you do, work from the soul as to the Lord and not as to people.
\v 24 You know that you will receive from the Lord the reward of the inheritance. You are serving the Lord Christ.
\v 25 For anyone who does unrighteousness will receive the penalty for the unrighteousness that he did, and there is no partiality.
