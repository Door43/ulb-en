\v 3 We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and we always pray for you.

\s5
\v 4 We have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all those set apart for God.
\v 5 You have this love because of the confident expectation reserved for you in heaven. You heard about this confident expectation before in the word of truth, the gospel,
\v 6 which has come to you. This gospel is bearing fruit and is growing in all the world. It has been doing this in you also from the day you heard it and learned about the grace of God in truth.

\s5
\v 7 This is the gospel as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf.

\v 10 We have been praying that you will walk worthily of the Lord in pleasing ways. We have been praying that you will bear fruit in every good deed and that you will grow in the knowledge of God.

\v 13 He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son.
\v 14 In his Son we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
\f + \ft Some versions read, \fqa In his Son we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins. \fqa* \f*

\s5
\v 15 The Son is the image of the invisible God. He is the first-born of all creation.
\v 16 For by him all things were created, those in the heavens and those on the earth, the visible and the invisible things. Whether thrones or dominions or governments or authorities, all things were created by him and for him.
\v 17 He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.

\s5
\v 18 He is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning and the first-born from among the dead ones, so he has first place among all things.
\v 19 For God was pleased that all his fullness should live in him,
\v 20 and to reconcile through the Son all things to himself. God made peace through the blood of his cross. God reconciled all things to himself, whether the things on the earth or the things in heaven.

\s5
\v 21 At one time, you also were strangers to God and were his enemies in mind and in evil deeds.
\v 22 But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through death. He did this in order to present you holy, blameless, and above reproach before him,
\v 23 if you continue in the faith, established and firm, not moved away from the confident expectation of the gospel that you heard. This is the gospel that was proclaimed to every person created under heaven. This is the gospel of which I, Paul, became a servant.

\s5
\p
\v 24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ for the sake of his body, which is the church.
\v 25 It is of this church that I am a servant, according to the responsibility from God that was given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God.
\v 26 This is the secret truth that was hidden for ages and for generations. But now it has been revealed to those who believe in him.
\v 27 It is to them that God wanted to make known the riches of the glory of this secret truth among the Gentiles. It is that Christ is in you, the confidence of future glory.

\s5
\v 28 This is he whom we proclaim. We admonish every person, and we teach every person with all wisdom, so that we may present every person complete in Christ.
\v 29 For this I labor and strive according to his energy that is at work in me in power.
