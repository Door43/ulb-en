\p
\v 1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 2 So they made him a supper there, and Martha was serving, while Lazarus was one of those who sat at table with Jesus.
\v 3 Then Mary took a litra of perfume made of pure nard, very precious, anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and wiped his feet with her hair;  the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.

\s5
\v 4 Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who would betray Jesus, said,
\v 5 "Why was not this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"
\v 6 Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief: he had charge of the moneybag and would take some of what was in it for himself.

\s5
\v 7 Jesus said, "Allow her to keep what she has for the day of my burial.
\v 8 The poor you will always have with you; but you will not always have me."

\s5
\p
\v 9 Now a large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but so that they might also see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
\v 10 The chief priests conspired together so that they might also put Lazarus to death;
\v 11 for it was because of him that many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus.

\s5
\p
\v 12 On the next day a great crowd came to the festival. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
\v 13 they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel."

\s5
\v 14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; as it was written,
\v 15 "Do not fear, daughter of Zion; see, your King is coming, sitting on the young of a donkey."

\s5
\v 16 His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.

\s5
\v 17 Now the crowd that had been with Jesus when he had called Lazarus out of the tomb and had raised him from the dead, bore witness to others.
\v 18 It was also for this reason that the crowd went out to meet him because they heard that he had done this sign. 
\v 19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "Look, you can do nothing; see, the world has gone after him."

\s5
\p
\v 20 Now certain Greeks were among those who were going up to worship at the festival.
\v 21 These went to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."
\v 22 Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip, and they told Jesus.

\s5
\v 23 Jesus answered them and said, "The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.
\v 24 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone; but if it dies, it will bear much fruit.

\s5
\v 25 He who loves his life will lose it; but he who hates his life in this world will keep it for everlasting life.
\v 26 If anyone serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.

\s5
\v 27 My soul is troubled now: what should I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But for this reason I came to this hour.
\v 28 Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came out of heaven and said, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again."
\v 29 Then the crowd that stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."

\s5
\v 30 Jesus answered and said, "This voice has not come for my sake, but for your sakes.
\v 31 Now is the judgment of this world: Now will the prince of this world be driven out.

\s5
\v 32 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."
\v 33 He said this to signify by what manner of death he would die.

\s5
\v 34 The crowd answered him, "We have heard from the law that the Christ will remain forever. How can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"
\v 35 Jesus then said to them, "Yet a little while longer is the light among you. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.
\v 36 While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may become sons of light."
\p Jesus said these things and then departed and hid from them.

\s5
\v 37 Although Jesus had done so many signs in front of them, yet they did not believe in him
\v 38 so that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said:
\q "Lord, who has believed our report?
\q And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
\m

\s5
\v 39 For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,
\q
\v 40 "He has blinded their eyes, and he has hardened their hearts;
\q otherwise they would see with their eyes and would perceive with their hearts,
\q and would turn,
\q and I would heal them."
\m

\s5
\v 41 Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke of him.
\v 42 Nevertheless, even many of the rulers believed in Jesus; but because of the Pharisees, they did not admit it so that they would not be banned from the synagogue.
\v 43 They loved the praise that comes from people more than the praise that comes from God.

\s5
\p
\v 44 Jesus cried out and said, "The one who believes in me, believes not only in me but also in him who sent me,
\v 45 and the one who sees me sees him who sent me.

\s5
\v 46 I have come as a light into the world so that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.
\v 47 If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have come, not to judge the world, but to save the world.

\s5
\v 48 The one who rejects me and who does not receive my words has one who judges him: it is the word that I have spoken which will judge him on the last day.
\v 49 For I did not speak of my own accord. Instead, it is the Father who sent me, who has given me the command about what I should say and what I should speak.
\v 50 I know that his command is life everlasting; so that thing that I say—just as the Father has said them to me, so I say to them."
