\c 6
\p
\v 1 After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, also called the Sea of Tiberias.
\v 2 A great crowd was following him, because they were seeing the signs that he was doing on those who were sick.
\v 3 Jesus went up the mountainside and sat down there with his disciples.

\s5
\v 4 (Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.)
\v 5 When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming to him, he said to Philip, "Where are we going to buy bread so that these may eat?"
\v 6 (Now Jesus said this to test Philip, for he himself knew what he was going to do.)

\s5
\v 7 Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be sufficient for each one to have even a little."
\v 8 One of the disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Jesus,
\v 9 "There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?"

\s5
\v 10 Jesus said, "Make the people sit down." (Now there was much grass in the place.) So the men sat down, about five thousand in number.
\v 11 Then Jesus took the loaves and after giving thanks, he distributed to those that were sitting. He then distributed the fish in the same way, as much as they wanted.
\v 12 When the people were filled, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the broken pieces which remain, so that nothing is wasted."

\s5
\v 13 So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves—the pieces left over from those who had eaten.
\v 14 Then when the people saw this sign that he did, they said, "This truly is the prophet who is to come into the world."
\v 15 When Jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him by force to make him king, he withdrew again up the mountain by himself.

\s5
\p
\v 16 When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake.
\v 17 They got into a boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. (It was dark by this time, and Jesus had not yet come to them.)
\v 18 By now a strong wind was blowing, and the sea was getting rough.

\s5
\v 19 Then when the disciples had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were afraid.
\v 20 However, he said to them, "It is I! Do not be afraid."
\v 21 Then they were willing to receive him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land where they were going.

\s5
\p
\v 22 The next day, the crowd that had been standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except the one and
that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples but that his disciples had gone away alone.
\v 23 (However, there were some boats that came from Tiberias close to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.)

\s5
\v 24 When the crowd discovered that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum seeking Jesus.
\v 25 After they found him on the other side of the lake, they said to him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"

\s5
\v 26 Jesus replied to them, saying, "Truly, truly, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate some of the loaves and were filled.
\v 27 Stop working for the food that perishes, but work for the food that endures to everlasting life which the Son of Man will give you, for God the Father has set his seal on him.

\s5
\v 28 Then they said to him, "What must we do, that we may do the works of God?"
\v 29 Jesus replied, "This is the work of God: that you believe in the one whom he has sent."

\s5
\v 30 So they said to him, "What sign then will you do, that we may see and believe you? What will you do?
\v 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, 'He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.'"

\s5
\v 32 Then Jesus replied to them, "Truly, truly, it was not Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but it is my Father who is giving you the true bread out of heaven.
\v 33 For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world."
\v 34 So they said to him, "Sir, give us this bread all the time."

\s5
\v 35 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life, he who comes to me will not hunger, and he who believes on me will never thirst.
\v 36 However, I said to you that you have seen me, and you still do not believe.
\v 37 All whom the Father gives me will come to me, and he who comes to me I will absolutely not drive away.

\s5
\v 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
\v 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that of all those whom he has given me I should not lose anyone, but should raise them up on the last day.
\v 40 For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day.

\s5
\p
\v 41 Then the Jewish leaders grumbled about him because he had said, "I am the bread that has come down out of heaven."
\v 42 They said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say, 'I have come down out of heaven'?'"

\s5
\v 43 Jesus replied, saying to them, "Stop grumbling among yourselves.
\v 44 No man can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day.
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.

\s5
\v 46 Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God—he has seen the Father.
\v 47 Truly, truly, he who believes has everlasting life.

\s5
\v 48 I am the bread of life.
\v 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.

\s5
\v 50 This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, so that a person may eat some of it and not die.
\v 51 I am the living bread that came down out of heaven. If anyone eats some of this bread, he will live forever. The bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world."

\s5
\p
\v 52 The Jews became angry among themselves and began to argue, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
\v 53 Jesus then said to them, "Truly, truly, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves.

\s5
\v 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
\v 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
\v 56 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.

\s5
\v 57 As the living Father sent me, and as I live because of the Father, so he who eats me, he will also live because of me.
\v 58 This is the bread that has come down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. He who eats this bread will live forever."
\v 59 Jesus said these things in the synagogue, while he was teaching in Capernaum.

\s5
\p
\v 60 Then many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, "This is a difficult teaching; who can accept it?"
\v 61 Jesus, because he knew in himself that his disciples were grumbling at this, said to them, "Does this offend you?

\s5
\v 62 Then what if you should see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?
\v 63 It is the Spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life.

\s5
\v 64 Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who the ones were who would not believe and who it was who would betray him.
\v 65 He said, "It is because of this that I said to you that no one can come to me unless it is granted to him by the Father."

\s5
\p
\v 66 After this, many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.
\v 67 Jesus said then to the twelve, "You do not want to go away also, do you?"
\v 68 Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of everlasting life,
\v 69 and we have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God."

\s5
\v 70 Jesus said to them, "Did not I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
\v 71 Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he, being one of the twelve, who would betray Jesus.
