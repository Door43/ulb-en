\c 18

\v 1 After Jesus spoke these words, he went out with his disciples over the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden into which he entered, he and his disciples.
\v 2 Now Judas, who was going to betray him, also knew the place, for Jesus often went there with his disciples.
\v 3 Then Judas, having received the group of soldiers and the officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
 
\s5
\v 4 Then Jesus, who knew all the things that were happening to him, went forward and asked them, “For whom are you looking?”
\v 5 They answered him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus said to them, “I am.” Judas, who betrayed him, was also standing with the soldiers.
 
\s5
\v 6 So when he said to them, “I am,” they went backward and fell to the ground.
\v 7 Then again he asked them, “For whom are you looking?” Again they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
 
\s5
\v 8 Jesus answered, “I told you that I am he; so if you are looking for me, let these others go.”
\v 9 This was so that the word might be fulfilled that he said: “Of those whom you have given me, I lost not one.”
 
\s5
\v 10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear. Now the servant’s name was Malchus.
\v 11 Jesus said to Peter, “Put the sword back into its sheath. The cup that the Father has given me, should I not drink it?”
 
\s5
\p
\v 12 So the group of soldiers and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him.
\v 13 They led him first to Annas, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
\v 14 Now Caiaphas was the one who had given the advice to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
 
\s5
\p
\v 15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest;
\v 16 but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the woman servant who was guarding the door and brought in Peter.
 
\s5
\v 17 Then the woman servant guarding the door said to Peter, “Are you not also one of this man’s disciples?” He said, “I am not.”
\v 18 Now the servants and the officers were standing there; they had made a fire of coals, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.
 
\s5
\p
\v 19 The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
\v 20 Jesus answered him, “I have spoken openly to the world; I was always teaching in synagogues and in the temple where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in private.
\v 21 Why did you ask me? Ask those who have heard me about what I said. These people know the things that I said.”
 
\s5
\v 22 When Jesus had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand and said, “Is that how you should answer the high priest?”
\v 23 Jesus answered him, “If I have said anything bad, bear witness to the evil. However, if I have answered well, why do you strike me?”
\v 24 Annas then sent Jesus bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
 
\s5
\p
\v 25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. The people then said to him, “Are you not also one of his disciples?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”
\v 26 One of the servants of the high priest, who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Did I not I see you in the garden with him?”
\v 27 Peter then denied again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
 
\s5
\p
\v 28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early in the morning, and they themselves did not enter the Praetorium so that they might not be defiled and so that they might eat the Passover.
\v 29 So Pilate went out to them and said, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?”
\v 30 They answered and said to him, “If this man were not an evil doer, we would not have delivered him up to you.”
 
\s5
\v 31 Pilate therefore said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.” The Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.”
\v 32 They said this so that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, the word that he had said that indicated by what kind of death he would die.
 
\s5
\p
\v 33 Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again and called Jesus; he said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
\v 34 Jesus answered, “Are you asking this of your own accord, or did others tell you to ask it of me?”
\v 35 Pilate answered, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me; what have you done?”
 
\s5
\v 36 Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, then my servants would fight so that I should not be delivered to the Jews. Actually my kingdom does not come from here.”
\v 37 Pilate then said to him, “Are you a king then?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this purpose I have been born, and for this purpose I have come into the world so that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”
 
\s5
\v 38 Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”  When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, “I find no crime in this man.
\v 39 You have the custom that I should release to you one man at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
\v 40 Then they cried out again and said, “Not this man, but Barabbas.” Now Barabbas was a robber.
