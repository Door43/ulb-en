\v 1 After this there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five roofed porticos.
\v 3 A great number of people who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed were lying in these porticos. \f + \ft  The best ancient copies omit the phrase, \fqa vs. 3 "waiting for the moving of the water" \f* 
\v 4 \f + \ft  The best ancient copies omit vs. 4, "For an angel of the Lord went down and stirred up the water at certain times and whoever stepped in while the water was stirring was healed from whatever disease he suffered from." \f*

\s5
\v 5 A certain man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
\v 6 When Jesus saw him lying there, and after he realized that he had been there a long time,  he said to him, "Do you want to be well?"

\s5
\v 7 The sick man replied, "Sir, I do not have anyone, when the water is stirred up, to put me into the pool. When I am trying, another steps down before me."
\v 8 Jesus said to him, "Get up, take up your mat, and walk."

\s5
\v 9 Immediately the man was healed, took up his bed, and walked.
\p Now that day was a Sabbath.

\s5
\v 10 So the Jewish leaders said to him who was cured, "It is the Sabbath, and you are not permitted to carry your mat."
\v 11 He replied, "He who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'"

\s5
\v 12 They asked him, "Who is the man that said to you, 'Pick up your bed and walk?'"
\v 13 However, the one who was healed did not know who it was because Jesus had withdrawn himself, for there was a crowd in the place.

\s5
\v 14 Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, "See, you have become well! Do not sin any more, lest something worse happens to you."
\v 15 The man went away and reported to the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.

\s5
\v 16 Now because of these things the Jewish leaders persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the Sabbath.
\v 17 Jesus told them, "My Father is working even now, and I, too, work."
\v 18 Because of this, the Jews sought all the more to kill him because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.

\s5
\p
\v 19 Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, the Son can do nothing of himself, except only what he sees the Father doing, for whatever the Father  is doing, the Son does these things also.
\v 20 For the Father loves the Son, and he is showing him everything that he himself does, and he will show him greater things than these so that you will be amazed.

\s5
\v 21 For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whomever he wishes.
\v 22 For neither does the Father judge anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son
\v 23 so that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.

\s5
\v 24 Truly, truly, he who hears my word and believes him that sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned but has passed out of death into life.

\s5
\v 25 Truly, truly, the time is coming and is here now when the dead will hear the voice of me, the Son of God, and they who hear will live.

\s5
\v 26 For as the Father has life in himself, thus he has given to the Son also to have life in himself,
\v 27 and the Father has given the Son authority to exercise judgment because he is the Son of Man.

\s5
\v 28 Do not be amazed at this, for there is a time coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice
\v 29 and will come out: those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.

\s5
\p
\v 30 I can do nothing from myself.  As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous because I am not seeking my own will but the will of him who sent me.
\v 31 If I should testify about myself alone, my testimony would not be true.
\v 32 There is another who testifies concerning me, and I know that the testimony that he gives about me is true.

\s5
\v 33 You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
\v 34 However, the testimony that I receive is not from man.  I say these things that you might be saved.
\v 35 John was a lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.

\s5
\v 36 Yet the testimony that I have is greater than that of John, for the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify concerning me that the Father has sent me.
\v 37 The Father who sent me, he has testified concerning me. You have neither heard his voice nor seen his form at any time. 
\v 38 You do not have his word remaining in you, for you are not believing in the one whom he has sent.

\s5
\v 39 You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life, and these same scriptures testify concerning me, 
\v 40 and you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.

\s5
\v 41 I do not receive praise from men,
\v 42 but I know that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.

\s5
\v 43 I have come in my Fatherâ€™s name, and you do not receive me.  If another should come in his own name, you would receive him.
\v 44 How can you believe, you who accept praise from one another but are not seeking the praise that comes from the only God?

\s5
\v 45 Do not think that I myself will accuse you before the Father. There is another one who accuses you, that is Moses on whom you have put your hopes.
\v 46 If you were believing Moses, you would be believing me because he wrote concerning me.
\v 47 If you do not believe his writings, how are you going to believe my words?"
