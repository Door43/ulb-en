\c 13
\p
\v 1 Let every soul be obedient to higher authorities, for there is no authority unless it comes from God; and the ones that exist have been appointed by God.
\v 2 Therefore he who resists that authority opposes the command of God; and those who oppose it will receive judgment upon themselves.

\s5
\v 3 For rulers are not a terror to  good deeds, but to evil deeds. Do you desire to be unafraid of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from it.
\v 4 For he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for he does not carry the sword for no reason. For he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath on the one who does evil.
\v 5 Therefore you must obey, not only because of the wrath, but also because of conscience.

\s5
\v 6 Because of this you pay taxes also. For authorities are servants of God, who attend to this very thing continually.
\v 7 Pay to everyone what is owed to them: tax to whom tax is due; toll to whom toll is due; fear to whom fear is due; honor to whom honor is due.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Owe no one anything, except to love one another. For he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.
\v 9 For, "You will not commit adultery. You will  not kill. You will not steal. You will not covet"â€”and if there is any other commandment also, it is summed up in this sentence: "You will love your neighbor as yourself."
\v 10 Love does not harm one's neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfilment of the law.

\s5
\p
\v 11 Because of this, you know the time, that it is already time for you to awake out of sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.
\v 12 The night has advanced, and the day has come near. Let us therefore put aside the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.

\s5
\v 13 Let us walk appropriately, as in the day, not in wild celebrations or drunkenness, not in sexual immorality or in uncontrolled lust, not in strife or jealousy.
\v 14 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts.
