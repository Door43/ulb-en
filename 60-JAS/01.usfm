\s5
\c 1
\v 1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion: greetings.
\v 2 Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you experience various trials.
\v 3 You know that the testing of your faith produces endurance.

\s5
\v 4 Let endurance complete its work, so that you will become fully developed and complete, and so that you will lack in nothing.
\v 5 But if any of you needs wisdom, let him ask for it from God, the one who gives generously and without rebuke to everyone who asks, and he will give it to him. 

\s5
\v 6 But let him ask in faith, without any doubt. For who doubts is like a wave in the sea that is moved by the wind and tossed around.
\v 7 For that person must not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.
\v 8 Such a person is double-minded, unstable in all his ways.

\s5
\v 9 Let the poor brother boast in his high position,
\v 10 but the rich brother in his low position, because he will pass away as a flower of the grass.
\v 11 For the sun rises with burning heat and dries up the grass. The flower falls off, and its beauty is lost. In the same way, the rich man will disappear while doing his activities.

\s5
\v 12 Blessed is the man who endures testing. For after he has passed the test, he will receive the crown of life, which has been promised to those who love God.
\v 13 Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God," because God is not tempted by evil, nor does he himself tempt anyone.

\s5
\v 14 But each person is tempted by his own evil desire, which drags him away and lures him.
\v 15 Then the evil desire conceives and gives birth to sin. And after the sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death. 
\v 16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.

\s5
\v 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above. It comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no changing or shadow of turning.
\v 18 God chose to give us birth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.

\s5
\v 19 You know this, my beloved brothers: let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.
\v 20 For the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God.
\v 21 Therefore put away all sinful filthiness and the excess of evil. In humility receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.

\s5
\v 22 Be doers of the word and not only hearers, deceiving yourselves.
\v 23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word but not a doer, he is like a man who examines his natural face in a mirror.
\v 24 He examines himself and then goes away and immediately forgets what he was like.
\v 25 But the person who looks carefully into the perfect law of liberty, and continues to do so, not just being a hearer who forgets, this man will be blessed in his doing.

\s5
\v 26 If anyone thinks himself to be religious, but if he does not control his tongue, he deceives his heart, and his religion is worthless.
\v 27 Pure and unpolluted religion before our God and Father is this: to help the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself spotless from the world.
